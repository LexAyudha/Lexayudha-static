1. **🎨 Chromatic Teaching Module** – Reduces visual stress through real-time contrast and font adjustments.
2. **🧾 Adaptive Content Generator** – Simplifies sentences using a fine-tuned BERT model for individualized reading levels.
3. **😐 Emotion Detection AI** – Real-time facial analysis with Xception and MTCNN to tailor task difficulty based on emotion.
4. **🔊 Speech Pace Optimizer** – CNN-RNN model predicts ideal speech rate and delivers audio via Google TTS.
5. **🧮 Touch Math Platform** – Gamified, multisensory math learning with voice feedback and interaction tracking.
